> **This is OpenDuckFrame-Enhanced, a community fork** of [Jun-bao/OpenDuckFrame](https://github.com/Jun-bao/OpenDuckFrame) (MIT). Original copyright and third-party notices are preserved. Changes:
> - **Unlocked 4K file interpolation**: file RIFE input cap raised from 1920×1080 to 3840×2160 (verified 4K X2 at a full 50fps, 100% coverage on Apple M2 Pro).
> - **Beginner-friendly workbench**: one-click enhance plus three auto-configuring preferences (Smoother / Auto / Clearer); advanced controls collapsed by default.
> - **Instant start**: file mode starts immediately (no 3s countdown); start delay configurable 0–20s (0 = instant).
> - **Interpolation health indicator**: live "working / not interpolating / awaiting keyframe" state with generated-frame coverage.
> - **Tunable pre-render**: `ODF_BUFFER_SECONDS` environment variable adjusts the lookahead buffer.

Frame generation uses **ODF-VFI**, a four-stage structural reduction of RIFE 4.25. It keeps the upstream weights without retraining and reduces model processing overhead. Existing RIFE 4.25 profiles remain compatible and run ODF-VFI; the app validates the actual four-stage weights when loading. Visual results remain content-dependent.

## About

OpenDuckFrame is a native Mac app that enhances the picture you are already watching.
Select a browser window, game or stream, a display, or a local video file, then
control frame generation and upscaling from one workbench. Processing happens on
your Mac, without an account or uploading your picture.

- **Frame generation.** ODF-VFI is the workbench's frame-generation model. Select a
  target frame rate or X2 / X3 / X4, and watch the actual output rate.
  Achieved performance depends on the source, settings and Mac.
- **Upscaling, independently.** Choose ArtCNN C4F32 or the lighter C4F16 model for native 2× SDR
  enhancement. Scaling and frame generation can be
  configured separately.
- **A workbench for everyday use.** Save profiles for games, films and animation;
  compare original and enhanced output. Window output follows the source window;
  display and video-file output can go fullscreen on a selected display.
- **A local video player, too.** Open formats including MKV, MP4, MOV and WebM,
  with subtitles, HDR playback on compatible displays, playback resume, speed
  control, and Finder Quick Look previews.
- **On-device subtitles.** Generate, translate and export text subtitles on
  supported macOS versions. macOS may download its language models first.
- **Private by design.** No account, ads, or playback analytics. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

The player has 17 interface languages; the enhancement workbench supports Chinese
and English. Experimental backends and constraints are described in [the feature guide](docs/features.md).

<p align="center"><sub>Earlier v0.1.0 interface. The current technology library lists ODF-VFI as its only frame-generation model.</sub></p>

## Get started

Download the [Mac app](https://github.com/Jun-bao/OpenDuckFrame/releases/latest/download/OpenDuckFrame.dmg)
or [browse releases](https://github.com/Jun-bao/OpenDuckFrame/releases).
The community download is ad-hoc signed and **not Apple notarized**, so macOS may
block its first launch. Only allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security if
you trust the source. Updates may require granting Screen Recording or
Accessibility access again because this community lane uses ad-hoc signing. Apple silicon and macOS 14+ are required.

The app checks for signed updates and lets you choose when to install them.
You can also use **OpenDuckFrame → Check for Updates**, or disable automatic
checks from the same menu. Updating never uploads your media.

1. Open **File → Quality Workbench** (⇧⌘E).
2. Choose a window, display, or video file input. macOS asks for Screen Recording
   permission when you capture a window or display.
3. Choose frame generation, upscaling, or both. For a window, press **Delayed Enhancement**
   and switch to the window you want before the countdown ends; that window is
   selected and enhanced automatically. The countdown defaults to 3 seconds and can
   be set from 1 to 20 seconds in the workbench **Settings**. For a display or
   video file, press **Start Enhancement**.
4. Use the original / enhanced / comparison controls and FPS display to check the result.

See [Quick start](docs/quick-start.md) for permissions and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

| Capability | Requirements |
|---|---|
| App and local playback | Apple silicon Mac, macOS 14 or later |
| Window / display capture | Screen Recording permission; protected content may not be capturable |
| ArtCNN super resolution | SDR input up to 1920×1080; native 2× output up to 3840×2160 |
| ODF-VFI frame generation | Apple silicon; throughput depends on resolution, quality and display rate |
| Subtitle generation and translation | macOS 26+ and an available system language model |
| Experimental animation backends | Additional models / runtimes; see [features](docs/features.md) |

Intel Macs, Windows, iPhone and iPad are not currently supported. A multiplier is
a requested processing mode, not a guarantee of a particular displayed frame rate.

When local-video frame generation cannot keep up, the original picture is kept and
late generated frames are discarded instead of delaying playback. This does not
mean the selected multiplier is reached on a slower Mac.

## Build from source

Use an Apple silicon Mac with Xcode and the macOS 26.4 SDK or later, Python 3,
and these build tools:

```sh
brew install xcodegen meson ninja cmake pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/Jun-bao/OpenDuckFrame.git
cd OpenDuckFrame
./Apps/Mac/Scripts/build.sh Debug
open .build/Build/Products/Debug/OpenDuckFrame.app
```

For an optimized local build:

```sh
./Apps/Mac/Scripts/build.sh Release
```

The build fetches pinned dependencies, generates the Xcode project, bundles runtime
libraries and verifies the application. Debug output stays under `.build/`; Release
also publishes a local `OpenDuckFrame.app` at the repository root. Local builds use
ad-hoc signing. Developer ID signing, notarization and App Store packaging have
their own [release workflow](RELEASING.md).

RifeMetal is prepared from a pinned source archive with the local stream IO
patch before project generation. See [the runtime recipe](ThirdParty/rife-metal/README.md)
for provenance, licenses and the generated package boundary.

Edit [`Apps/Mac/project.yml`](Apps/Mac/project.yml), not the generated Xcode project.
Optional experimental runtimes are not built by default; see [the feature guide](docs/features.md#optional-runtimes).
