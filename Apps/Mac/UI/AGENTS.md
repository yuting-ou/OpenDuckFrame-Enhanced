# Mac interface

Own native windows, menus, player interaction and enhancement configuration here.
[AppDelegate.swift](AppDelegate.swift) handles app lifecycle and open actions.
[PlayerViewController.swift](PlayerViewController.swift) connects playback, chrome and file enhancement.
[PlayerWindowController.swift](PlayerWindowController.swift), [MainMenu.swift](MainMenu.swift) and [SPChrome.swift](SPChrome.swift) own their native presentation.

## Enhancement workbench

[Enhancement/EnhancementWorkbench.swift](Enhancement/EnhancementWorkbench.swift) owns profiles, migration, configuration actions, source/output controls and the workbench window.
[Enhancement/LiveFPSOverlay.swift](Enhancement/LiveFPSOverlay.swift) formats live FPS observations.
The engine selector offers ODF-VFI, Apple low latency and Apple FRC. New/default-reset profiles use Apple low latency normal X2 where the runtime supports it; unsupported devices retain ODF-VFI fast X2. Preserve explicit saved engines and legacy migration when loading profiles. ODF-VFI has fast/balanced/hq tiers; persisted `rife-v4.25` identifiers remain for compatibility. Apple low latency uses X2/X4 for live capture and X2 for files, without fixed FPS or X3. FRC has standard/quality tiers for live capture and standard for files. Keep rate controls and quality choices consistent with the selected source and engine.
The workbench offers Apple low-latency and Apple video super resolution; preserve the disabled-by-default scale switch and migrate legacy scaler profiles without altering frame-generation settings.
The workbench always shows enhanced output; legacy original/compare view settings migrate to enhanced.
Keep continuous stream caching enabled by default and window output fixed to follow with mouse passthrough.
The normal countdown defaults to 3 seconds; keep saved countdown and custom settings working.
Hardware/configuration auto-detection is deferred. Keep its suggestions and scoring out of ordinary controls.
Preserve configuration add/rename/delete, preset metadata and saved-profile migration.
The three-step first-use coach marks are implemented in [WorkbenchOnboarding.swift](Enhancement/WorkbenchOnboarding.swift); keep them skippable, source-specific and replayable from Help.
Keep delayed window selection available beside the selected-window start action, including before a source is chosen. The selected-window action must offer Cancel throughout its countdown and initial engine preparation. During enhancement, show Stop Enhancement in the start action's position; preserve restart after Stop and pending Apply Changes actions.
The window list requires Screen Recording access. Automatic refresh does not prompt; an explicit refresh requests access and, if it remains denied, explains the need and links directly to System Settings. Refresh must not open the system window picker. After returning from Settings, refresh the list if access is available.
Live source preview and failed initial preparation also retain a Stop action while capture runs. Show unapplied enhancement settings in the visible status. Optional window-optimization eligibility is not the interpolation state; never present its ineligibility reason as source-only playback when the ordinary engine is active.
Periodic preview status must preserve existing errors and warnings. Pending settings name only enabled features; a scale-only preview must not advertise a disabled interpolation engine or frame multiplier.
File output retains its fullscreen control; display and window output follow their source without a fullscreen preview option.
The workbench is a compact controls-only window. Keep its preview endpoint disconnected; file video stays in the player and live enhancement uses its actual output view.
Apple low latency in live window/display mode offers Content timing: General window / Automatic video. Old profiles retain General window. Automatic video requests a 60 FPS capture ceiling without replacing the saved general-mode cap, reports estimated 24/25/30 FPS or detection in progress, and leaves audio in the source app. Keep this choice hidden for files and other engines; preserve it when saving configurations.

## UI validation

Run `./Scripts/test_workbench_store.sh` for profile, countdown or workbench action changes.
Run `./Scripts/test_workbench_guide.sh` for coach-mark preferences, navigation and source-specific guidance.
Run `./Scripts/test_screen_capture_permission.sh` and `./Scripts/test_window_permission_prompt.sh` for window selection permission changes; the latter does not replace native permission and capture validation.
Use the existing localization catalog and EnhancementText flow according to the current surface.
Verify actual English/Chinese, light/dark, source types, long names and keyboard actions when affected.
Check default 560×700, minimum 540×620, native fullscreen and ordinary window resizing for layout changes.
Keep the controls usable when parameters scroll.
Preferred fill constraints must yield to window resizing; AppKit's window size priority is 500.
Native rendering and real controls are the UI acceptance evidence. Parse or store tests cover a narrower layer.
Coordinate live pipeline changes with [Capture](../Capture/AGENTS.md) and shared file playback with [Modules](../../../Modules/AGENTS.md).
