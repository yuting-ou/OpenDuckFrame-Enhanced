# Live capture and enhancement adapters

[WindowCapture.swift](WindowCapture.swift) contains WindowCaptureSource and ScreenCaptureKit selection/capture.
[SPLiveProcessor.h](SPLiveProcessor.h) defines live request and resolved-plan contracts.
[SPLiveProcessor.mm](SPLiveProcessor.mm) processes, schedules and presents live enhancement.
[SPRifeEngine.swift](SPRifeEngine.swift) bridges the pinned RIFE runtime.
The Apple and animation scaler adapters here also serve file playback through the media framework.
Read [project.yml](../project.yml) for their actual target membership.

## Preserve pipeline contracts

Keep source generation, configuration epochs, frame ownership, timestamps and cancellation coherent across asynchronous work.
Keep source identity separate from capture running state; Stop can retain a selectable source.
Preserve verified source/content geometry, Retina/display mappings and stale-frame rejection when following windows.
Keep capture callbacks distinct from source-content changes and physical presentation observations.
Apple low-latency live preparation fits inference to runtime size limits and restores generated frames to source dimensions. Keep the strict file preparation path separate. Report actual inference dimensions; reduced inference can soften generated detail and does not enable super resolution.
Apple low-latency enhanced live output requests at least 80 ms adaptive buffering within existing time/memory caps, and reuses the bounded temporal display queue. Keep this scoped to that engine/mode; preserve RIFE, FRC and source-only behavior.
The opt-in automatic-video mode samples six interior regions before inference queue eviction, estimates visible 24/25/30 FPS, and retimes full captures into rational 60 kHz PTS buckets. Sampling never alone discards picture detail: a bucket retains its latest full capture until closure. One owned pending capture is released on stop/context changes; old timers and model outputs retain revision/generation/clock guards. Detection failure uses source pictures. This mode requests 140 ms buffering within a 160 ms time cap and existing byte limits; it must not infer native-video cadence from whole-window callbacks.
For capture and inference sizing or performance admission, follow the root [hardware optimization scope](../../../AGENTS.md#hardware-optimization-scope). Derive limits from the selected source and engine capabilities; do not turn a test machine's model identifier or screen dimensions into product eligibility rules. Keep model identifiers in diagnostic evidence, and preserve real API compatibility checks.
The automatic Fast X2 window fallback uses Metal/Apple GPU/unified-memory capabilities and a bounded BGRA capture budget, never model identifiers. Preparation first measures three warmed full-size inference jobs; preserve native dimensions when the median fits 75% of a display interval. Only a budget miss or preparation failure selects the shared 1080p-area fallback and its existing keeper/presenter. Unsupported fallback formats or refresh rates retain ordinary engine preparation. Preparation timings are not sustained FPS acceptance. File preparation remains separate.
UI selectors and persisted profile behavior belong to [UI](../UI/AGENTS.md).
File cadence and shared provider contracts belong to [VideoEnhancement](../../../Modules/VideoEnhancement/AGENTS.md).

## Focused verification

Choose the scripts relevant to the changed policy and read their prerequisites first.
`./Scripts/test_capture_callback_policy.sh` checks callback policy.
`./Scripts/test_capture_resize_policy.sh` checks resize state and stale callback guards.
`./Scripts/test_content_frame_gate.sh` checks content gating.
`./Scripts/test_apple_live_size.sh` uses the built Debug app for real Apple inference, large/portrait input geometry and live plan activation; it does not record or present a window.
`./Scripts/test_live_display_queue.sh` checks queue selection and bounded temporal order on CPU. `./Scripts/probe_apple_live_presentation.sh OUTPUT.json [steady|jitter]` opens a 23-second synthetic test window using the built Debug app's processor/presenter. It records actual drawable presentation, not ScreenCaptureKit or user-media acceptance.
`./Scripts/test_video_cadence.sh` covers estimation, still scenes, rate changes and rational retiming. The visible probe also accepts `source25`, `auto24`, `auto25`, `auto30` (26 seconds); automatic profiles must actually detect their source rate and release pending capture on stop.
`./Scripts/test_output_geometry.sh` and `./Scripts/test_shared_geometry.sh` cover geometry policies.
`./Scripts/test_air_window_optimization.sh` checks GPU capability and native frame-budget admission.
`./Scripts/test_air_beta_sizing.sh` checks byte-bounded capture and adaptive processing sizing.
`bash Scripts/test_window_optimization_preparation.sh` requires the built Debug app and runs real GPU preparation/generation for native and forced-budget fallback, ordinary preparation and oversized rejection. It does not capture or present a window.
These checks do not establish Screen Recording permission, real source capture or physical output correctness.
For a live task, record selected source, dimensions, generation/configuration and actual presented output.
Capture, requested target and presented FPS are separate measurements.
Keep diagnostic hooks task-scoped and gated; remove temporary instrumentation before delivery.
